        We could have written document_path(id: doc.id, slug: doc.slug, ref: maybe_ref);
        but it's better to use the link_resolver, as it allows you to maintain in one place
        the way all the documents' URLs are supposed to be written, whatever their types.

    Passing the ref parameter allows to keep it if we're previewing a future release.
    Note: if @ref is the master ref, then @maybe_ref is nil (allowing to discard the parameter here).
